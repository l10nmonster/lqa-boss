- **Ctrl+Left**: Previous page
- **Ctrl+Right**: Next page
- **CMD+K** (Mac) / **Ctrl+K** (Windows): Focus search filter

## Advanced Filtering System

The app includes a powerful real-time filtering system for both screenshot and text-only modes:

### Filter Interface
- **Search Input**: Located in the top-right corner of the editor panel
- **Filter Settings Menu**: Click the sliders icon (‚öôÔ∏è) to customize searchable fields
- **Real-Time Results**: Segments are filtered instantly as you type
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Use `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to quickly focus the search

### Searchable Fields
Configure which fields to include in your search via the filter settings menu:

- ‚úÖ **Source**: Search in source text content
- ‚úÖ **Target**: Search in target/translated text content  
- ‚úÖ **Notes**: Search in segment notes and descriptions
- ‚úÖ **RID**: Search by Resource ID numbers
- ‚úÖ **SID**: Search by Segment ID numbers
- ‚úÖ **GUID**: Search by unique segment identifiers

### Filter Behavior
- **Case-Insensitive**: All searches ignore letter case
- **Partial Matching**: Matches any text containing your search term
- **Multi-Field**: Search across multiple selected fields simultaneously  
- **Smart Navigation**: Active segment auto-deselects when filtered out
- **Preserve Context**: Filter persists across page navigation in screenshot mode

## File Format

The app works with .lqaboss files, which are ZIP archives containing:
- `job.json`: Translation units with normalized source/target text
- `flow_metadata.json`: (Optional) Metadata about pages and text segments for screenshot mode
- Image files: Screenshots referenced in the metadata (when flow_metadata.json exists)

### Data Structure
- **Translation Units**: Core editing elements with source (`nsrc`) and target (`ntgt`) normalized text arrays
- **Normalized Text**: Supports strings and placeholders for HTML tags and variables
- **Dual Mode**: Screenshot mode (with flow metadata) or text-only mode (job data only)
- **State Management**: Three-state system tracking original, saved, and current versions for accurate change detection
- **Smart Exports**: Only exports changed translation units to optimize file sizes and performance

2. **Push to main branch** to trigger deployment:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Access your site** at: `https://[your-username].github.io/lqa-boss/`

The workflow automatically:
- Builds the React app
- Uploads artifacts
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Handles service worker and PWA manifest paths

## Google Cloud Storage Setup

### Prerequisites for GCS Integration

1. **Google Cloud Project**: Create or use existing GCP project
2. **OAuth2 Client ID**: Create web application credentials in Google Cloud Console
   - Go to APIs & Credentials ‚Üí OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
   - Add your domain to authorized origins (e.g., `https://yourdomain.github.io`)
3. **GCS Bucket**: Create bucket with appropriate permissions
4. **CORS Configuration**: Configure bucket for browser access

### CORS Configuration Example
```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://your-bucket-name
```

Where `cors.json` contains:
```json
[
  {
    "origin": ["https://yourdomain.github.io", "http://localhost:3000"],
    "method": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "responseHeader": ["*"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
